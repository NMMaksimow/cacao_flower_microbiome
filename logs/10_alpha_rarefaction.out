Output files generated (5 rarefaction curves):

UNFILTERED DATA (for comparison):
- CFM_16S_unfiltered_alpha_rarefaction.qzv
- CFM_ITS1_unfiltered_alpha_rarefaction.qzv

FILTERED DATA (for analysis):
- CFM_16S_filtered_chloro_mito_singl_lowprev3_alpha_rarefaction.qzv
- CFM_16S_filtered_prokaryotes_only_singl_lowprev3_alpha_rarefaction.qzv
- CFM_ITS1_filtered_fungi_only_singl_lowprev3_alpha_rarefaction.qzv

Next steps:
1. Download and view ALL .qzv files at https://view.qiime2.org
2. Compare unfiltered vs filtered rarefaction curves
3. Compare 16S full vs prokaryotes-only datasets
4. Choose optimal rarefaction depths for downstream diversity analysis
5. Document your chosen depths and rationale for methods section
