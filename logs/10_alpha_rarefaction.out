=== RAREFACTION ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===
Unfiltered rarefaction curves:
- 16S unfiltered rarefaction: 2.9M
- ITS1 unfiltered rarefaction: 2.5M

Filtered rarefaction curves:

Output files generated:
UNFILTERED DATA (for comparison):
- CFM_16S_unfiltered_alpha_rarefaction.qzv
- CFM_ITS1_unfiltered_alpha_rarefaction.qzv

FILTERED DATA (for analysis):
- CFM_16S_filtered_full_alpha_rarefaction.qzv (includes eukaryotic DNA)
- CFM_16S_prokaryotes_only_alpha_rarefaction.qzv (bacterial microbiome only)
- CFM_ITS1_filtered_alpha_rarefaction.qzv (fungal communities)

ANALYSIS TOOLS:
- rarefaction_analysis_report.txt (comprehensive depth recommendations)
- analyze_rarefaction_depth.py (enhanced analysis script)

Next steps:
1. Download and view ALL .qzv files at https://view.qiime2.org
2. Compare unfiltered vs filtered rarefaction curves
3. Compare 16S full vs prokaryotes-only datasets
4. Review the comprehensive text report for recommended depths
5. Choose your analysis approach:
   - Use 16S FULL for pathogen-inclusive analysis
   - Use 16S PROKARYOTES for standard bacterial microbiome
   - Use both approaches for comprehensive publication

Important comparisons to make:
- Unfiltered vs filtered curves show filtering impact
- 16S full vs prokaryotes-only shows eukaryotic DNA contribution
- Use appropriate dataset recommendations for downstream analysis
- Document both approaches in your methods section
